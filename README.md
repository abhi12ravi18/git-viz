# github-viz

## Steps I followed during this task:

1. **Configure a destination on my SCP Trial account - to link GitHub's REST API and SCP**
    - This solved the CORS issue I was facing.

2. **Tried to consume the service directly from Web IDE's wizard to make Master-Detail app, but was not successful**
    - I may have missed some step here, service shows up but when I add a relative URL, it says 404 error - very weird

3. **Changed the relative URL as well, it was still crashing with a different type of error**
    
    - Relative URL of the service I provided: `/users/sap/repos?sort=full_name`

4. **I changed tracks and made a free-style UI5 app and now using AJAX requests, I'm trying to build the UI**
